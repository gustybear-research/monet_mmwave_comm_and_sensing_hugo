Imagine a future where our wireless devices do more than just talk to each other. They can also "see" and "feel" their surroundings, gathering valuable information about the environment. This is the promise of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), and millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies are the key to unlocking its full potential. Leveraging the abundant bandwidth at mmWave band (30GHz ~ 300GHz), which are currently being explored for future generation of wireless communication systems (cellular and Wi-Fi), radar-like precise and multi-target detection can be implemented, with applications in drone detection, physiological monitoring, smart RAN etc. This VIP project, therefore, sees to develop new techniques and technologies to make ISAC a reality at mmWave frequencies.
