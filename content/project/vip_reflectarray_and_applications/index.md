# Executive Summary
Reflectarray present a paradigm shift in wireless communication and sensing in mmWave and sub-THz region by offering unprecedented control over the propagation environment. Traditional wireless systems are largely at the mercy of the channel, which can be severely impaired by obstacles, fading, and interference. Reflectarray, however, introduce a new degree of freedom by enabling programmable manipulation of the wireless channel. Through precise control of the reflection and refraction properties of an array of elements, reflectarray can be used to mitigate path loss, combat fading, null interference, and shape radiation patterns, which can be used to enhancing spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and expanding coverage. This project aims to investigate the fundamental principles of reflectarray operation, develop novel reflectarray architectures and control algorithms, and explore their applications in a wide range of wireless communication, sensing, energy transfer, and security scenarios.
