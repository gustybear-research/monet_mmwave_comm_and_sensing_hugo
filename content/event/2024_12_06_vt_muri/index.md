summary: Present our research work on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).
abstract: "This seminar will explore the cutting-edge realm of future generation (FutureG) wireless communication systems, with a specific emphasis on the revolutionary capabilities of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). To illustrate the practical applications of these research areas, two significant projects from Yao's laboratory will be highlighted. The first project focuses on developing energy-efficient liquid metal RIS to improve signal coverage and multi-user support of FR2 (28GHz) small cell network at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam aircraft hangar. The second project involves prototyping an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system for vital sign monitoring and patient triage at Queen's Medical Center."
