I am a doctoral student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. My research interests are in the domain of communications and network security.  I am currently working on non-coherent spectrum sensing techniques in next generation dynamic spectrum access networks. Other areas of interest are in technologies for critical infrastructure security, adversarial machine learning, differential privacy, and privacy issues of web/mobile advertising.
